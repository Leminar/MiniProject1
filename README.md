- `client`: Contains the React front-end code.
- `server`: Contains the Node.js back-end code.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Node.js Backend Server**:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project-root/server
     ```
   - Start the Node.js server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

2. **Start the React Front-end**:
   - Navigate to the `client` directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project-root/client
     ```
   - Start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. Access your React app in a web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Components

### App.js (Functional Component)

This is the entry point of the React app. It renders the `UserContainer` component.

### UserList.js (Functional Component)

This component displays a list of users received as props.

### UserContainer.js (Class Component)

This component manages state and handles API interactions. It fetches user data from the Node.js server and passes it to `UserList`.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure CORS is enabled on your Node.js backend to allow communication with your React app.
- Modify components to fit your specific requirements and data structure.
- Add error handling and loading states for a better user experience.
