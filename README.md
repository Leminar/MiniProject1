# miniporject 4

The code sets up an Express.js server for a user management web app, reading user data from a 'users.json' file on startup. It defines an API endpoint '/api/users' to simulate asynchronous data fetching and renders the user data using an EJS template. The server listens on port 3000, providing a basic structure for a user management application with asynchronous data handling.

# Event Loop
1. Initialization: Node.js initializes an event loop, a continuous process that manages asynchronous tasks in a single-threaded environment.

2. Execution Stack: The main program execution starts with functions pushed onto the execution stack, and asynchronous tasks use callbacks to signal completion.

3. Callback Queue: Completed asynchronous callbacks are placed in a queue, waiting to be processed during the event loop's pending callbacks phase.

4. Phases: The event loop consists of phases like timers, poll, and check, each handling specific types of tasks in a well-defined order.

5. Non-Blocking Efficiency: Node.js' non-blocking I/O operations allow it to handle numerous concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for scalable and real-time applications.

## Usage

a. Clone this repository to your local machine.

b. Navigate to the project directory:

c. Install the required dependencies by running:

Start the server: Access the user API endpoint by visiting
 http://localhost:3000/api/users.
